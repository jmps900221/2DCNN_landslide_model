# 2DCNN_landslide_model
2D CNN model for landslide
This code performs landslide sensitivity prediction using a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Due to the large size of the data files, they cannot be uploaded and I do not have permission to share them publicly. Please refer to the code for reference.

The codes can be used for academic purpose only.
